    <!-- 1. Note that the LI's are blue, even though we did not specify a colour on them 
        It's inheriting the style fom the UL. Similarly, notice how it's overriding the colour to blue from red
        even though we set the body to be red. This is because of CSS Specificty, when there are conflicting styles
        the browser will take the most specific style 
    -->

        <li>Person 2</li>
        <li>Person 3</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- 2. Let's look at the developer tools and notice two things:
        1) The inherited style - Also note that although there is a linked CSS file stating to show the ul as purple, 
        it's being overridden. What happens if we move it to the end of the file?
        2) The overridden style

    <!-- 3. What happens if I set li to be green? Let's remove the comment and inspect this -->
